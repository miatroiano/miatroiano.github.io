## Yup!
[View Project](https://github.com/miatroiano/InteractiveScene)

#### Language used:
- Java

#### About the Program:
- This program is an RPG game based off of the movie Nope. It was made by myself and two other classmates.
  -  In the Game you play as a hourse names Lucky, who lives on a ranch with OJ and Emerald Haywood
  -  A UFO is trying to capture Luckey, but to escape the UFO you have to find portals to take you to multiple puzzles. 
  -  There are 5 portals and 5 puzzles, you can ask some of the people in the town for help, but the final puzzle might be difficult to find. 
  -  You must complete the first four before you can play the final puzzle.  
  -  The first puzzle is a simple matching game, you have to move the hourse statue onto the correct tile to win but you might
      accidentally trigger a spike trap. 
  -  The second puzzle looks like a simple maze, however there are spike traps you might accidental walk on and arrow traps 
      that will shoot if you are two close.
  -  In the third puzzle you are trapped by walls, but in each room there is part of the wall where you can escape. 
  -  The fourth puzzle is an obsticle course where you must get to the end without loosing all of your health. 
  -  The final puzzle is where you have to escape the UFO, the UFO does damage so it may not be easy. 
  -  The last part of the game is footage of UFO attempting to take Lucky. 

#### Challenges:
-  As a team the biggest struggle for us was working together. In the beginning had a difficult time communicating 
    with eachother and getting all of our tasks done each sprint. 
-  Personaly I struggled with some of the mechanics of the game like the screen switching, and the traps.
