## About the code

That is all.
I've always been interested in video games, around the age of 10 I was playing a lot of Minecraft. My mom noticed this and enrolled me in a programming summer camp called ID Tech. There I took a course on coding in Minecraft with Java Script. Over the years I kept playing video games and became interested in making them. At 16 I went to another ID Tech camp where I learned Unreal Engine and some C++, I realized I really enjoyed coding that summer. I then ended up taking IB Computer science my junior year of high school. I never thought I would end up as a computer science major because I planned on going into law, but my teacher told me that I should major in it because I can almost do anything with the degree, so I listened to him. Programming for me is something that can drive me crazy trying to figure out a problem but the joy and relief I get from solving them out weighs any frustration.
